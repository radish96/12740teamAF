We met with the following goals today:
1. Integrate our circuit in a way that makes more physical sense
2. Develop a comprehensive explanation of the logic behind our system
3. Start to understand Open Chirp

Previously, our set up was a bit arbitrary given that we simply were trying to integrate things, not necessarily in the most user-friendly or logical way. Today we refactored our device so that we are have divided our system into two parts: the first part contains all of the sensors and lights associated with the traffic light, the second part contains all of the sensors and lights that will act as the pedestrian signal. We did this with the intent that the traffic signal will ultimately be physically separate from the sensors on the pedestrian signal. More specifically, the traffic signal contains a motion sensor and vibration for collectively detecting cars. It also will have the photosensitive sensor for detecting the sunlight. Finally, it has three LEDs (red, yellow, and green) that represent the actual traffic lights. The pedestrian signal subsystem has a motion and sound sensor for collectively detecting pedestrians and it has six LEDs attached to it. Three of those LEDs are red and three are green with the intention of the green LEDs representing the pedestrian light walk sign and the red LEDs representing the pedestrian light stop sign. We introduced more LEDs in order to represent brightness of the pedestrian signal better. We will plan to implement this particular feature later in the week. 

Previously, we explained eight conditions that would set off different results in the system. We later broke those down into fewer conditions to simplify the code. In order to thoroughly understand those conditions, we developed the block diagram given in the image below.

This image shows the rough sketch of the block diagram and will be updated to be more presentable later in the week. This block diagram shows how our code flows. It starts with checking if there is a person or not. If there is no person, then the entire signal is turned off. It then moves on to checking if there is a car, and finally moves to check if the traffic signal is red or not. Here, we added another condition at the end that checks how much time is left in the traffic light phase. We do this to eliminate the case where the pedestrian arrives at the signal and the traffic light is almost at the end of it's red phase. If we had kept our scheme from before, the pedestrian light would turn green, indicating that the pedestrian should cross, when in reality the pedestrian only has one or two seconds to cross, which is not sufficient time for crossing the street safely. Thus we define some threshold for time required for the pedestrian to cross the street safely. If the amount of time remaining in the traffic light phase is greater than this threshold, then the pedestrian light may be turned green and the pedestrian may cross the street. If not, then the pedestrian light should turn on but remain red. 

This code and reimplementation of the circuits introduced a wide variety of complexity to our system that presented itself as a minor roadblock in our current progress. We spent an increasing amount of time debugging and ensuring that our logic was sound and each if statement made sense.
